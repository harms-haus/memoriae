# fix-build-and-tests

- run `./build.sh` and resolve any build errors. Continue resolving build errors until the build succeeds.
- run `./build.sh` and resolve any test failures. Use the design or plan as the ground-truth, not the code or tests. Continue resolving test failures and build errors until the build errors and tests failures are completely resolved.
